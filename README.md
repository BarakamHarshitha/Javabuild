# My Java Application

This is a Java application that uses Maven as the build tool and is containerized using Docker. This README provides instructions on how to build, run, and use the application.

## Prerequisites

- **Java JDK 17** (for building and running the application locally)
- **Maven 3.8.x** (for building the project)
- **Docker** (for containerizing and running the application in a Docker container)

## Project Structure

my-java-app/ │ ├── Dockerfile ├── pom.xml └── src/ └── main/ └── java/ └── com/ └── example/ └── App.java

## Building the Application

### Using Maven

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/my-java-app
Build the project with Maven:

mvn clean package
This will compile the code, run tests, and package the application into a JAR file located in the target directory.

Docker Instructions
Building the Docker Image
Navigate to the project directory:

cd /path/to/my-java-app
Build the Docker image:

docker build -t myapp:latest .
This command builds the Docker image and tags it as myapp:latest.

Running the Docker Container
Run the Docker container:

docker run -p 8080:8080 myapp:latest
This command starts a container from the myapp:latest image and maps port 8080 of the container to port 8080 on the host. Adjust the port number as needed.

Verify the Application is Running

Open a web browser or use a tool like curl to access the application. For example:

curl http://localhost:8080
Application Configuration
Port: The application runs on port 8080 by default. You can configure this by modifying the Dockerfile or the application’s configuration files.
Common Issues and Troubleshooting
Container Exits Immediately: Ensure that your Java application is designed to run indefinitely. If it’s a web server or long-running process, verify that it’s configured correctly.
Network Issues: If you cannot access the application, check firewall settings and ensure that the port is correctly mapped and open.
